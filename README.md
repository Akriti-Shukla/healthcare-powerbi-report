## üìä Healthcare Waitlist Analysis ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard

### üîç Project Overview  
This Power BI report analyzes **patient waiting lists** in the healthcare sector (2018‚Äì2021). 
It provides insights into current patient volumes, historical trends, and specialty/age-level breakdowns for **Inpatient** and **Outpatient** cases. 
Built for healthcare decision-makers, the report supports data-driven operational planning.

### üéØ Business Problems Addressed  
Healthcare administrators needed a solution to:  
1. **Track** current status of waitlists  
2. **Analyze** historical trends across case types  
3. **Drill down** by age and medical specialty  

---

## 1: Requirement Gathering  
- Mapped key stakeholders (ops leads, analysts)  
- Defined goals via stakeholder conversations  
- Finalized KPIs: *Average Waitlist*, *Median Waitlist*, *Total Current Waitlist*  
- Outlined scope and timelines for development  

---

## 2: Data Collection  
- Used **Folder Connector** in Power BI  
- Loaded Inpatient and Outpatient CSVs for scalable data management  

---

## 3: Data Transformation (Power Query)  
- Standardized column names  
- Added missing fields (`Case_Type`, `Age_Profile`)  
- Appended data into a single unified table: `All_Data`  
- Trimmed and replaced values for cleanliness  

---

## 4: Data Modeling  

- Built clean relationships and hid unnecessary tables  
- Optimized model size and performance  

---

## 5: Dashboard Design & DAX Measures  
- Designed custom background layout (using PNG)  
- Created **toggle slicers** for Average/Median view  
- Added **dynamic titles**, **no-data messages**, and **tooltips**  
- Built DAX measures for latest month, prior year, and case filters  

```DAX
Dynamic Title = 
SWITCH(
   VALUES('Calculation Method'[Calc Method]),
   "Average", "Key Indicators - Patient Wait List (Average)",
   "Median", "Key Indicators - Patient Wait List (Median)"
)
```
